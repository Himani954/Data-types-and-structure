        "A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It's based on the idea of resources, which are identified by URIs, and can be manipulated using a fixed set of operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Resource-Based : Everything in REST is a resource (e.g., users, products, orders).\n",
        "2. Client-Server Architecture : The client and server are separate, with the client making requests to the server to access or modify resources.\n",
        "3. Stateless : The server doesn't maintain any information about the client state between requests.\n",
        "4. Cacheable : Responses from the server can be cached by the client to reduce the number of requests.\n",
        "5. Uniform Interface : A uniform interface is used to communicate between client and server, which includes HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URI syntax, and standard HTTP status codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "HTTP Methods\n",
        "\n",
        "1. GET : Retrieve a resource\n",
        "2. POST : Create a new resource\n",
        "3. PUT : Update an existing resource\n",
        "4. DELETE : Delete a resource\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Scalability : RESTful APIs are designed to scale horizontally, making it easy to handle increased traffic.\n",
        "2. Flexibility : RESTful APIs can be used with various programming languages and frameworks.\n",
        "3. Easy to Implement : RESTful APIs are relatively simple to implement, especially when using existing HTTP infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Common Use Cases\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Web Services : RESTful APIs are widely used for web services, such as social media platforms, online banking, and e-commerce websites.\n",
        "2. Microservices Architecture : RESTful APIs are often used in microservices architecture to enable communication between different services.\n",
        "3. Mobile App Development : RESTful APIs are used to provide data to mobile apps, enabling them to interact with backend services.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example\n",
        "\n",
        "A simple example of a RESTful API would be a user management system that allows clients to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Retrieve a list of users (GET /users)\n",
        "- Create a new user (POST /users)\n",
        "- Update an existing user (PUT /users/{userId})\n",
        "- Delete a user (DELETE /users/{userId})\n",

        "3. Provide Examples : Include examples of API requests and responses to illustrate usage.\n",
